## Quick Start

### Pre-Travel Preparation (48 hours before)
```bash
# Run complete pre-travel security preparation
./scripts/pre-travel-prep.sh --destination china --duration 14days

# Create encrypted backups of essential data
./scripts/backup-creation.sh --encryption-level maximum

# Sanitize devices of sensitive information
./scripts/device-sanitization.sh --travel-profile clean
```

### Border Crossing Preparation
```bash
# Set up travel-safe browser and communication
./configs/travel-browser/setup-clean-browser.sh

# Configure country-specific VPN settings
./configs/vpn-profiles/setup-vpn.sh --country china

# Run final device security check
./tools/device-analyzer/final-security-scan.sh
```

### Post-Travel Restoration
```bash
# Restore backed up data and configurations
./scripts/post-travel-restore.sh --verify-integrity

# Re-enable high-security services and accounts
./scripts/restore-security-services.sh

# Run post-travel security audit
./tools/device-analyzer/post-travel-audit.sh
```
